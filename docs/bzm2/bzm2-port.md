# BZM2 Mujina Port

## Architecture

This port keeps BZM2 support inside Mujina rather than reviving the original split `cgminer` + `bzmd` process model.

The legacy split looked like this:

- `cgminer` handled scheduling, pool interaction, and IPC to `bzmd`
- `bzmd` owned UART transport, job fanout, result validation, and board-management glue

In Mujina, those responsibilities map cleanly onto existing abstractions:

- `Daemon` can attach a configured `bzm2` board directly from serial-path configuration
- `Backplane` instantiates the board through the virtual-board registry
- `board::bzm2::Bzm2Board` opens serial transports and creates hash threads
- `asic::bzm2::Bzm2Thread` performs direct UART job dispatch, telemetry parsing, and share validation
- `board::power` provides reusable GPIO-reset and PMBus/I2C rail sequencing primitives

A standalone Rust daemon is therefore not required for the mining path.

## Bring-Up And Shutdown

`Bzm2Board` now supports optional board-level power and reset sequencing through
the existing `VoltageStackBringupPlan`.

The current generic integration path uses file-backed adapters:

- rail setpoint files for coarse voltage application
- optional rail enable files for regulator enable or precharge control
- an optional reset file for ASIC reset assertion and release

This keeps the implementation generic across custom Linux-based carriers without
hard-coding one vendor board layout or management MCU protocol.

## Implemented Behavior

The BZM2 Mujina thread now reimplements the core legacy data path and the generally reusable portions of the control path:

- 20 x 12 logical engine grid with the four excluded engines from legacy code
- enhanced-mode 4-midstate dispatch per logical engine
- version-rolling micro-jobs in slots `0, 2, 4, 8`
- UART register writes for target bits, leading-zero threshold, and timestamp count
- TDM result parsing with sequence parity matching
- nonce correction via enhanced-mode nonce gap
- in-thread Bitcoin header reconstruction and share validation before scheduler submission
- UART opcode coverage for:
  - `WRITEJOB`
  - `WRITEREG`
  - `READREG`
  - `MULTICAST_WRITE`
  - `READRESULT`
  - `NOOP`
  - `LOOPBACK`
  - `DTS_VS`
- DTS/VS generation 1 and generation 2 frame decoding
- live DTS/VS gen2 hardware-fault handling that shuts down the hash thread on thermal or voltage fault indications
- reusable GPIO reset-line control through `AsicEnable`
- reusable TPS546 PMBus rail control through `VoltageRegulator`
- reusable multi-rail bring-up and shutdown sequencing for single-rail, small-stack, and larger multi-stack designs
- UART-register-based PLL diagnostic/control flow for divider programming, enable/disable, lock polling, and readback
- UART-register-based DLL diagnostic/control flow for duty-cycle programming, enable/disable, lock polling, and fincon validation
- domain-aware BZM2 tuning planner documented in [bzm2-pnp.md](bzm2-pnp.md) for operating-class and performance-mode target selection, search-space generation, and per-domain plus per-ASIC tuning

  default `25`
- `MUJINA_BZM2_BRINGUP_RELEASE_RESET_MS`: delay after reset release, default
  `25`

Startup enumeration notes:

- this mode is intended for fresh chains where ASICs still answer on the
  default `ASIC_ID`
- enumeration uses a bounded `NOOP` probe so the chain walk terminates cleanly
  at the end of the bus
- if no default-id ASIC responds on startup, Mujina falls back to the configured
  `MUJINA_BZM2_ASICS_PER_BUS` topology so warm-restart cases do not collapse to
  zero ASICs

Bring-up notes:

- if bring-up is enabled, `Bzm2Board` applies the configured rail/reset
  sequence before chain discovery, calibration, and hash-thread creation
- when the tuning planner produces per-domain voltage targets, `Bzm2Board`
  now applies them onto the configured rail-control path before the PLL ramp
  rather than treating them as advisory only
- saved operating-point replay now reapplies persisted per-domain voltages
  before clock replay when the profile contains them
- if multiple domains are mapped onto one rail, the runtime requires them to
  agree on the same target voltage; conflicting targets fail loudly instead of
  applying an ambiguous setpoint
- on board shutdown, the same plan is used in reverse order to assert reset and
  drive the configured rails back to `0`
- the current implementation is still coarse-grained at the regulator layer:
  it applies domain targets onto configured rails, but it does not yet perform
  closed-loop voltage verification against live rail telemetry or runtime retune

If the optional rail telemetry files are configured, the board monitor also
publishes them into normal board state using stable names:

- `rail0-input`, `rail1-input`, ... for input-side voltage snapshots
- `rail0-output`, `rail1-output`, ... for output-side voltage/current/power
- `rail0-regulator`, `rail1-regulator`, ... for regulator temperatures

## API Telemetry

When Gen2 `DTS_VS` frames are present on the UART path, Mujina now surfaces ASIC-internal telemetry through the normal board API state:

- `BoardState.temperatures`
- `BoardState.powers`

The values are named per serial bus and per ASIC so they can coexist with host-side sensor files:

- temperature: `ttyUSB0-asic-2-dts`
- voltage channels: `ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch0`, `ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch1`, `ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch2`

Example JSON fragment:

```json
{
  "temperatures": [
    { "name": "ttyUSB0-asic-2-dts", "temperature_c": 64.5 }
  ],
  "powers": [
    { "name": "ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch0", "voltage_v": 0.78, "current_a": null, "power_w": null },
    { "name": "ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch1", "voltage_v": 0.79, "current_a": null, "power_w": null },
    { "name": "ttyUSB0-asic-2-vs-ch2", "voltage_v": 0.77, "current_a": null, "power_w": null }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- these ASIC-originated entries are merged into board state and do not replace host-file telemetry
- Celsius and voltage scaling follow the legacy `bzmd` DTS/VS conversion formulas
- Gen1 currently exposes voltage through this path, but not a Celsius temperature reading

## On-Demand ASIC Sensor Queries

Mujina now supports explicit DTS/VS query operations in addition to passive frame reporting.

This is useful when:

- the miner is idle and no passive DTS/VS traffic is arriving
- one ASIC is misbehaving and needs targeted inspection
- developers want a direct sensor read without enabling a full TDM watch session

The query path is exposed through the HTTP API:

- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/dts-vs-query`

The query path runs through the live BZM2 hash-thread actor so UART ownership remains correct. Queried frames are converted through the same telemetry code path used for passive DTS/VS reporting, so the returned values land in normal `BoardState` telemetry.

Example HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v0/boards/bzm2-0/bzm2/dts-vs-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"thread_index":0,"asic":2}'
```

## On-Demand Engine Discovery

Mujina also supports explicit per-ASIC engine-map discovery when the thread is
idle.

This is useful when:

- an ASIC is returning unstable shares and the default engine-hole assumption is
  no longer trustworthy
- developers need to compare the live engine map against the historical default
  BZM2 hole pattern
- operators want the discovered topology recorded in normal board API state

The engine-discovery path runs through the live BZM2 hash-thread actor, just
like the DTS/VS query path, so UART ownership stays correct. Successful scans
update the live thread engine layout and `BoardState.asics` with:

- `id`
- `thread_index`
- `serial_path`
- `discovered_engine_count`
- `missing_engines`

After a successful idle-time scan, subsequent work dispatch and result
reconstruction use the discovered active-engine layout instead of the built-in
default four-hole map.

HTTP API:

- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/discover-engines`

Example HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v0/boards/bzm2-0/bzm2/discover-engines \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"thread_index":0,"asic":2,"tdm_prediv_raw":15,"tdm_counter":16,"timeout_ms":150}'
```

The response returns the refreshed `BoardState`, including the updated
`asics` topology entry for the queried ASIC.

## API Diagnostics

The board/API surface now exposes a first live UART diagnostics slice through
the BZM2 thread actor:

- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/noop`
- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/loopback`
- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/register-read`
- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/register-write`
- `POST /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/clock-report`

These commands intentionally route through the live board-owned thread instead
of opening a second serial handle. That keeps UART ownership correct and avoids
silent contention with the mining path.

Current safety boundary:

- the target thread must be idle
- DTS/VS streaming must be inactive on that thread

If either condition is false, the command is rejected rather than racing active
mining traffic or background telemetry frames.

`clock-report` returns the same PLL/DLL status surface used by the low-level
UART diagnostics during development:

- PLL enable register
- PLL misc register
- PLL enabled/locked bits
- DLL control2/control5 values
- DLL `coarsecon`
- DLL `fincon`
- DLL freeze-valid, lock, and fincon-valid state

## Chain Summary

The board/API surface also exposes the current BZM2 chain layout without
opening a second serial handle:

- `GET /api/v0/boards/{name}/bzm2/chain-summary`

The response summarizes:

- current UART bus count
- serial path per bus
- global ASIC start/count per bus
- total ASIC count across the board
- whether the active operating point came from saved replay or live calibration
- current saved operating point validation state

That gives operators a stable summary view of the active chain layout even when
the underlying board was discovered by startup enumeration rather than static
configuration alone.

## Design Boundary

The legacy `bzmd` board-power path mixes three different concerns:

- genuinely reusable sequencing concepts
- generic peripheral protocols like PMBus/I2C regulators and reset GPIOs
- highly board-specific MCU command sets, sysfs GPIO numbering, CAN PSU control, and platform wiring assumptions

Only the first two belong in a generally applicable Mujina BZM2 implementation.

Ported into Mujina:

- generic reset assertion/deassertion
- generic ordered rail bring-up and shutdown
- generic PMBus/TPS546 voltage control and telemetry adapters
- ASIC-originated DTS/VS telemetry and fault handling

Intentionally not ported verbatim:

- Intel board MCU command protocol from `mcu.c`
- hard-coded board GPIO numbering and sysfs reset pulses from `util.c` / `daemon.c`
- platform CAN PSU control from `psu.c`
- board-specific fan and ambient-sensor plumbing that depends on the original platform layout

Those pieces should only be added behind a concrete Mujina board implementation when the target hardware actually uses them.

## Current Limits

Still not implemented from the broader legacy stack:

- JTAG workflows from the standalone platform documents
- JTAG-only PLL debug sequences that are not represented in the shipped UART code
- calibration and autotuning state machines
- full manufacturing and diagnostics RPC parity
  - beyond the current live API surface for:
    - `NOOP`
    - loopback
    - register read/write
    - clock report
    - chain summary
- any board-MCU protocol that is specific to one carrier or backplane design

This port currently implements the opcode surface that is evidenced in the legacy shipping UART path and not an inferred JTAG control plane.
