# Blockscale / BZM2 UART And TDM Protocol Reference

## Purpose

This document summarizes the ASIC-facing UART protocol, TDM behavior, and job
programming model needed to write host software or validation tooling for the
Blockscale / BZM2 ASIC family.

It is written as a practical reference for:

- firmware developers
- board bring-up engineers
- validation engineers
- host software developers

## Link Characteristics

The legacy host software consistently assumes:

- default ASIC UART baud: `5 Mbps`
- `1.2 V` IO signaling on UART-related pads
- a reference / slow-clock environment derived from a `50 MHz` source during
  early bring-up

Practical recommendation:

- establish communication at `5 Mbps` first
- validate signal integrity there before attempting any custom timing changes

## Addressing Model

Each command carries:

- `ASIC_ID`
- opcode
- engine or group identifier
- register offset or data payload, depending on opcode

The documented system addressing model allocates:

- normal engine space for engine tiles
- top `0xFxx` engine-ID region for non-engine / local functions such as PLLs,
  sensors, and internal controller blocks

Do not assume engine IDs are contiguous or fully populated. Disabled or missing
engines create holes that software must tolerate.

## ASIC Identification

Relevant ID values used during system bring-up:

- `0xFA`: default ID before enumeration
- `0xFF`: platform-wide broadcast ID

Enumeration rule:

- writing a unique `ASIC_ID` to an ASIC previously addressed at `0xFA` also
  unlocks forwarding so the next ASIC becomes reachable

## Routing Modes

### Unicast

Use unicast when you need:

- one register or job to one engine in one ASIC
- per-ASIC tuning
- precise debug
- result ownership validation

### Broadcast

Use broadcast when you need:

- the same action on the same target across all ASICs
- coarse startup programming
- coarse frequency ramps
- fast deployment of common work or dummy work

### Multicast

Use multicast when you need:

- row-wise engine programming
- efficient fanout inside one ASIC or across ASICs
- validation flows that target equivalent engine positions

Multicast write acts as a row-group fanout mechanism and is also used as the
basis for some broadcast-style write patterns.

## Opcode Summary

| Opcode | Name | Primary use | Typical response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0` | `WRITEJOB` | Write engine job state and launch work | No immediate payload response |
| `0x1` | `READRESULT` | Poll ASIC result buffer in non-TDM mode | Result record with status |
| `0x2` | `WRITEREG` | Write engine or local registers | No immediate payload response |
| `0x3` | `READREG` | Read engine or local registers | Register data |
| `0x4` | `MULTICAST_WRITE` | Write a row-group of engines | No immediate payload response |
| `0xD` | `DTS_VS` | Read thermal and voltage sensor data | Sensor payload |
| `0xE` | `LOOPBACK` | Echo payload for transport validation | Echoed payload |
| `0xF` | `NOOP` | Link and chain liveness test | ASCII `BZ2` |

## Frame Structure

The legacy software and opcode notes use a leading length field followed by the
actual command header and payload.

### `NOOP`

Purpose:

- confirm the ASIC is synchronized with the host
- confirm chain reachability

Behavior:

- transmit a short command to a specific ASIC
- receive three ASCII bytes: `BZ2`

Practical use:

- first link test after setting baud
- chain walk after programming IDs
- low-risk sanity check during debug

### `WRITEJOB`

Purpose:

- deliver engine work over UART

Documented behavior:

- writes `42` consecutive bytes of job state
- typical transmit length is `48` bytes including framing

Payload content includes:

- `32` bytes of midstate
- merkle root residue
- start timestamp
- sequence ID
- job control

Header construction described in the opcode notes:

```text
header = (asic << 24) | (WRITEJOB << 20) | (engine << 8) | 41
```

### `READRESULT`

Purpose:

- poll the ASIC-level result buffer directly in non-TDM mode

Returned fields include:

- status
- engine ID
- sequence ID
- nonce
- timestamp

A clear valid bit is not the same as a framing error. The host is expected to
consume the full response length even when no valid result is present.

### `WRITEREG`

Purpose:

- write a target register range

Documented behavior:

- length is `7 + count`
- payload uses a byte count field encoded as `count - 1`

Common uses:

- enabling clocks
- programming nonce bounds and target
- local-register setup for TDM, clocking, or sensors

### `READREG`

Purpose:

- read a target register range

Practical uses:

- register validation during bring-up
- ASIC-local debug
- clock and sensor status inspection

### `MULTICAST_WRITE`

Purpose:

- write one register range to multiple engines identified by a row-group ID

Common uses:

- row-wise initialization
- engine-wide or board-wide debug patterns
- efficient deployment of common register state

### `LOOPBACK`

Purpose:

- validate the link by echoing a chosen payload

Use cases:

- transport validation before full job submission
- characterization of chain reliability at length
- regression tests after changing clocks, cabling, or PHY conditions

### `DTS_VS`

Purpose:

- retrieve thermal and voltage-sensor data

It can be used:

- directly as a query
- indirectly through TDM streaming when enabled

## Enhanced-Mode Job Programming

Enhanced mode is the normal software contract for engine operation.

Required setup before job submission:

- enable TCE clocks via config register `0x01`
- program `StartNonce` at `0x3C`
- program `EndNonce` at `0x40`
- program `Target` at `0x44`
- load the four midstates beginning at `0x10`

### Four-write sequence

| Write | `0x30` MR residue | `0x34` start timestamp | `0x38` sequence ID | `0x39` job control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WriteJob_0` | same value | same value | `0b00` | `0x0` |
| `WriteJob_1` | same value | same value | `0b01` | `0x0` |
| `WriteJob_2` | same value | same value | `0b10` | `0x0` |
| `WriteJob_3` | same value | same value | `0b11` | `0x1` or `0x3` |

Key rule:

- only the fourth write should launch execution

If `JobControl` is asserted too early, the job can be launched in an incomplete
state.

## Job Control Semantics

The documented values are:

- `0x0`: clear pending only
- `0x1`: mark pending ready
- `0x2`: clear current and pending, return to idle
- `0x3`: abort current and immediately promote pending

Practical guidance:

- use `0x1` for orderly sequencing
- use `0x3` for preemption when the current search space is stale
- use `0x2` to recover from invalid or hung engine state before resuming work

## Partial, Incomplete, And Invalid Programming

The hardware documentation is explicit that bad sequences are not harmless.

### Dummy jobs

When writing dummy jobs:

- zero the midstate and merkle-residue content for the unused lanes

Reason:

- residual values can otherwise generate nonces that do not belong to the host
  work model

### Disabled TCEs

If some TCEs are disabled:

- software still has to maintain valid sequence structure
- disabled lanes should receive zeroed dummy content
- valid lanes can still carry production work

### Partial write-job hazards

If a write-job is incomplete:

- missing bytes can be consumed from the next write
- unintended nonce generation can occur

Do not treat UART framing problems as soft performance issues. They are
functional correctness problems.

## TDM Overview

TDM lets ASICs stream data back to the host in time slots associated with ASIC
IDs.

The hardware interface used by the shipped software assumes:

- an ASIC owns TX opportunity when the slot matches its `ASIC_ID`
- the ASIC begins transmission after a programmed TDM delay
- TDM can carry multiple response classes including register responses, results,
  `NOOP`, and thermal / voltage data

The shipped software implies a practical example:

- with `128` bit-time slots at `5 MHz`, a TDM frame is approximately `2.5 ms`

That matters because it bounds result and telemetry latency across a long chain.

## Result Aggregation Model

The shipped software uses a two-stage buffering model:

- each engine tile has an `8`-deep local result FIFO
- the ASIC notch block has a `16`-deep ASIC-level result FIFO

Host-visible implications:

- local tile FIFOs are scanned about every `300 us`
- results are aggregated before entering the TDM slot stream
- under expected mining conditions, FIFO overflow should be rare
- overflow bits still need to be handled because overflow means lost nonces

## Sensor Streaming And Querying

### TDM sensor behavior

Thermal and voltage telemetry are exposed as a TDM payload source in the
implemented interface. The voltage / thermal packet is treated as the fourth
packet class in TDM operation.

### Direct query behavior

`DTS_VS` can also be used as a direct query opcode when explicit on-demand
sensor retrieval is needed.

This is the model now exposed through the runtime thread path and HTTP API in
this repository.

## DTS / VS Payload Layout

The implemented 8-byte sensor payload requires the host to extract:

- thermal tune code
- thermal validity / enable bits
- thermal-trip status
- voltage enable bit
- voltage shutdown / fault status
- voltage raw codes for `ch0`, `ch1`, and `ch2`
- PLL lock state bits when present in the response generation

### Voltage channels

The three channels represent:

- `ch0`: bottom stack voltage
- `ch1`: top stack voltage
- `ch2`: differential between stacks

These raw values should be converted into engineering units before being used
for protection or calibration decisions.

## Sensor Conversion Equations

### Temperature

```text
T = K + Y * (N - 2^11 / 2^R) / 2^12
```

Where:

- `T` = Celsius
- `N` = raw tune code
- `R` = resolution
- `Y = 631.8`
- `K = -293.8`

### Voltage

```text
V = 1000 * (2 / 5) * VREF * (6 * N / 2^14 - 3 / 2^R - 1)
```

Where:

- `V` = mV
- `N` = raw voltage code
- `R` = resolution
- `VREF = 0.7067`

## `NOOP` Timing Caution

The legacy timing rules include a specific warning for `NOOP`:

- do not issue back-to-back `NOOP` commands with only one stop bit of spacing
- in non-TDM mode, maintain at least a three-byte gap between consecutive
  `NOOP`s

Treat this as a real transport rule during low-level validation.

## Practical Host Strategy

For production-capable software, a good division of labor is:

- use broadcast or multicast for common initialization
- use unicast for identity assignment and final trim
- use TDM for steady-state results and telemetry
- use direct `READREG`, `READRESULT`, `NOOP`, `LOOPBACK`, and `DTS_VS` for
  debug and validation

That is also how the Rust tooling in this repository is structured.

## Practical Validation With This Repository

Relevant follow-on references in this repository:

- [ASIC Integration Guide](blockscale-asic-integration-guide.md)
- [BZM2 Port Note](bzm2-port.md)

The Rust implementation already exposes:

- board and API diagnostics for `NOOP`, loopback, register reads and writes,
  and clock reporting
- direct `DTS_VS` telemetry query through the board API
- result parsing and engine-map discovery through the runtime thread path
